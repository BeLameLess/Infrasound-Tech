# Infrasound Technology: Development, Detection, Protection, and Societal Implications

## 1. Introduction to Infrasound

Infrasound is defined as low-frequency sound that falls below the range of human hearing (typically below 20 Hz). These waves can be generated by both natural (earthquakes, volcanoes, wind) and man-made sources (industrial machinery, vehicles, explosions).

## 2. Development of Portable Infrasound Devices

### 2.1. Low-Frequency Transducer
- **Types:** Electro-dynamic subwoofers, vibration transducers (shakers), pneumatic transducers.
- **Selection Criteria:** Frequency response (2-20 Hz), power handling, efficiency, size, and weight.

### 2.2. Signal Generator
- **Functionality:** Creates precise electronic waveforms corresponding to desired infrasonic frequencies.
